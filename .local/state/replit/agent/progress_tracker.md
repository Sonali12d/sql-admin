## Google Cloud Run Build Error Fix

### Issue
Build failed during Google Cloud Run deployment with error:
```
Could not resolve entry module "client/index.html"
```

### Root Cause
- Vite configuration had `root: path.resolve(__dirname, "client")` but build wasn't explicitly specifying the entry point
- Docker build process couldn't resolve the correct path to index.html

### Solution Implemented

[x] 1. Fixed Vite build configuration
   - Added explicit `rollupOptions.input` in vite.config.ts pointing to `client/index.html`
   - Updated build command to explicitly reference config file
   - Build now completes successfully in 34.64s ✅

[x] 2. Verified build output
   - Frontend assets generated in `dist/public/` directory
   - index.html and all assets present
   - Build ready for Docker deployment ✅

## Previous Fixes (Completed)

[x] 3. Fixed UserResponse schema in Replit
   - Added `is_admin: bool = False` field to `api/schemas.py`
   - Backend now properly sends admin status to frontend
   - Admin panel access working in Replit ✅

[x] 4. Updated Dockerfile for Google Cloud Run deployment
   - Added Node.js 20.x installation
   - Simplified package dependency handling (only requires package.json)
   - Added frontend build step (`npm run build`)
   - Fixed COPY order to avoid package-lock.json errors
   
[x] 5. Configured FastAPI to serve static files and handle SPA routing
   - Added StaticFiles mounting for /assets directory
   - Added catch-all route to serve index.html for non-API routes
   - Ensures proper routing for admin panel and all client-side routes

## Deployment Instructions

### For Google Cloud Run:
```bash
# Deploy to staging
gcloud builds submit --config=cloudbuild.staging.yaml

# Or deploy to production
gcloud builds submit --config=cloudbuild.prod.yaml
```

## Status
- ✅ Build Error: FIXED - Vite build working correctly
- ✅ Replit: FIXED - Admin panel working
- ✅ Google Cloud Run: READY TO DEPLOY - All issues resolved
