## Application Status ðŸš€

- **Frontend**: Built and running on port 5000 âœ…
- **Backend API**: Running on port 8000 âœ…
- **Redis Worker**: Running and processing jobs âœ…
- **Database**: PostgreSQL configured âœ…
- **Deployment**: Configured for Google Cloud Run (Docker-based) âœ…

## Next Steps for User ðŸ“‹

The application is now fully migrated and ready to use. You can:
1. Deploy to Google Cloud Run (Dockerfile is configured)
2. Start developing new features
3. The frontend is accessible at the webview on port 5000
4. All workflows should be running correctly

## Issues Resolved ðŸ”§

1. **Railway Error**: Fixed "Please run 'npm run build' first" by building frontend
2. **Redis Worker Import Error**: Fixed Python module imports by setting correct working directory
3. **Concurrently Not Found**: Resolved by restarting workflow with proper environment
4. **Deployment Config**: Added build and run commands for production deployment
5. **[x] Railway CORS Issue**: Updated CORS configuration to support Railway domains via environment variables (RAILWAY_PUBLIC_DOMAIN or FRONTEND_URL)
6. **[x] Vercel Configuration Error**: Fixed conflicting `builds` and `functions` properties in vercel.json
7. **[x] Vercel Serverless Functions Limit**: Added .vercelignore and updated vercel.json to deploy only static frontend (no serverless functions)
8. **[x] Login CORS Error**: Added custom CORS middleware to automatically allow all Vercel domains (*.vercel.app)
9. **[x] Railway Integration Removed**: Removed railway.toml and RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md, updated documentation for Google Cloud Run

## Deployment Configuration âœ…

### Google Cloud Run Setup
- **Container**: Docker-based deployment using unified Dockerfile
- **Build**: `pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt && npm run build`
- **Runtime**: FastAPI backend + Redis worker in single container
- **Port**: 5000 (configurable via PORT env var)
- **Health Check**: `/api/health` endpoint

### Required Environment Variables
- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection (Cloud SQL)
- `REDIS_URL` - Redis connection (Memorystore)
- `JWT_SECRET` - JWT authentication secret
- `ADMIN_SECRET_KEY` - Admin access secret
- Optional OAuth: `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`, `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`
