# SQLGym Admin Panel 404 Fix - Progress Tracker

## Issue
Admin panel returned 404 error on Google Cloud Run when users with `is_admin=true` tried to access `/admin-panel` route directly.

## Root Cause
The production deployment was missing frontend build and SPA routing configuration:
1. Dockerfile only built Python backend, not the frontend
2. FastAPI was not configured to serve static files
3. No catch-all route to serve index.html for client-side routes

## Solution Implemented
[x] 1. Updated Dockerfile to include Node.js and build frontend
   - Added Node.js 20.x installation
   - Added npm ci for dependency installation
   - Added npm run build to compile frontend assets
   
[x] 2. Configured FastAPI to serve static files and handle SPA routing
   - Added StaticFiles mounting for /assets directory
   - Added catch-all route to serve index.html for non-API routes
   - Ensured proper routing for admin panel and all client-side routes
   
[x] 3. Updated progress tracker with completed fixes

## Next Steps
- User needs to rebuild and redeploy to Google Cloud Run with updated Dockerfile
- After deployment, admin panel will be accessible at /admin-panel for users with is_admin=true
