# SQLGym Migration Progress Tracker

## Completed Items
[x] 1. Migration to Docker-only build strategy completed
[x] 2. Removed GitHub Actions three-stage deployment workflows
[x] 3. Removed all .env files for security
[x] 4. Removed environment-specific Dockerfiles and cloudbuild files
[x] 5. Updated api/config.py to use environment variables directly (no dotenv)
[x] 6. Simplified cloudbuild.yaml for single Docker build strategy
[x] 7. Updated .gitignore to prevent .env file commits
[x] 8. Created comprehensive Docker deployment documentation (DOCKER_DEPLOYMENT.md)
[x] 9. Updated replit.md with new Docker-only deployment strategy
[x] 10. All configuration now managed via environment variables injected at runtime
[x] 11. Fixed Vite build configuration - added explicit rollupOptions.input for Docker builds
[x] 12. Corrected rollupOptions.input to use relative path (index.html) since root is set to client/
[x] 13. FINAL FIX: Removed explicit rollupOptions.input - Vite auto-detects index.html in root directory
[x] 14. Verified build works locally - frontend compiles successfully to dist/public/
[x] 15. Fixed Google OAuth login error - added GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID and GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET environment variables
[x] 16. Verified Google OAuth is now properly configured and enabled
[x] 17. Application successfully restarted with Google OAuth working
[x] 18. Changed post-login redirect URL from "/" to "/home"
[x] 19. Updated backend OAuth routes to redirect to /home after successful authentication
[x] 20. Updated frontend routing to support /home as the authenticated home page
[x] 21. Updated landing page to navigate to /home after successful login
[x] 22. Fixed S3 endpoint error in Google Cloud Run - stripped whitespace from AWS environment variables
[x] 23. CORRECTED: Implemented two-factor admin authentication requiring BOTH JWT token AND ADMIN_SECRET_KEY
  - Backend verify_admin_user_access now validates user's JWT token (from Authorization header or cookie)
  - Validates ADMIN_SECRET_KEY from X-Admin-Key header
  - Checks user has is_admin=true in database
  - No automatic admin user creation
  - Frontend AdminContext updated to send both Authorization header (JWT) and X-Admin-Key header (admin secret)
  - All admin API calls in SolutionsTab updated to include both headers
  - Other admin components (DataSourceTab, SchemaInfoTab, CreateQuestionTab) use AdminContext functions

## Summary
✅ All migration and authentication tasks completed
✅ Google OAuth login is fully functional
✅ Users now redirected to /home after successful login
✅ Application running successfully on Replit environment
✅ Fixed S3 endpoint construction error caused by whitespace in Google Cloud Secret Manager variables
✅ **CORRECTED:** Admin panel authentication now properly enforces two-factor security
  - Users must be logged in (JWT token) AND provide ADMIN_SECRET_KEY
  - User must have is_admin=true set manually in database
  - No automatic admin user creation when admin key is provided
  - Fixes Google Cloud Run admin access control issues
  - Ensures only authorized users with admin privileges can access admin panel
