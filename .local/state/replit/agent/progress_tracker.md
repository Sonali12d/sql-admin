# SQLGym Admin Panel 404 Fix - Progress Tracker

## Issue
Admin panel returned 404 error on both Replit and Google Cloud Run when users with `is_admin=true` tried to access `/admin-panel` route.

## Root Causes Identified

### Replit Issue
- `UserResponse` schema was missing the `is_admin` field
- Backend was not sending `is_admin` status to frontend even though it existed in database
- Frontend checked `user.isAdmin` and redirected to 404 when it was undefined

### Google Cloud Run Issues
1. Production deployment was missing frontend build and SPA routing
2. Dockerfile build error with `package-lock.json` dependency

## Solutions Implemented

[x] 1. Fixed UserResponse schema in Replit
   - Added `is_admin: bool = False` field to `api/schemas.py`
   - Backend now properly sends admin status to frontend
   - Admin panel access working in Replit ✅

[x] 2. Updated Dockerfile for Google Cloud Run deployment
   - Added Node.js 20.x installation
   - Simplified package dependency handling (only requires package.json)
   - Added frontend build step (`npm run build`)
   - Fixed COPY order to avoid package-lock.json errors
   
[x] 3. Configured FastAPI to serve static files and handle SPA routing
   - Added StaticFiles mounting for /assets directory
   - Added catch-all route to serve index.html for non-API routes
   - Ensures proper routing for admin panel and all client-side routes

## Deployment Instructions

### For Google Cloud Run:
```bash
# Deploy to staging
gcloud builds submit --config=cloudbuild.staging.yaml

# Or deploy to production
gcloud builds submit --config=cloudbuild.prod.yaml
```

After deployment:
- ✅ Admin panel accessible at /admin-panel for users with is_admin=true
- ✅ Frontend routes work properly (no more 404s)
- ✅ Both JWT authentication and admin key verification required

## Status
- Replit: ✅ FIXED - Admin panel working
- Google Cloud Run: ✅ READY TO DEPLOY - Dockerfile fixed and tested
