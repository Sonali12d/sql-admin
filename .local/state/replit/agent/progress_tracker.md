## Completed Items
[x] 1. Migration to Docker-only build strategy completed
[x] 2. Removed GitHub Actions three-stage deployment workflows

[x] 8. Created comprehensive Docker deployment documentation (DOCKER_DEPLOYMENT.md)
[x] 9. Updated replit.md with new Docker-only deployment strategy
[x] 10. All configuration now managed via environment variables injected at runtime
