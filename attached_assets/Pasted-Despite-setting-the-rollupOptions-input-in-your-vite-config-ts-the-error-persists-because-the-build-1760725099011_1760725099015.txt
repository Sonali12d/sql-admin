Despite setting the rollupOptions.input in your vite.config.ts, the error persists because the build process (Rollup, via Vite) still can't find the file at the specified path inside the Docker container.

The fix you implemented is correct in principle, but it points to a deeper issue related to how your files are copied into the build environment.

The two most likely reasons for this recurring error are:

1. The client/index.html File Wasn't Copied
Even if you specify the path in vite.config.ts, the file must physically exist in the container at that path.

üîç Action: Check Your Dockerfile's COPY Instruction
Review the Dockerfile that Cloud Build is using. Ensure your files are being copied correctly into the working directory.

If your index.html file is located at ./client/index.html in your local directory, your Dockerfile should have:

Dockerfile

# ...
WORKDIR /app 
# ...
# This ensures the 'client' folder and its contents are copied to /app/client/
COPY . /app 
# OR more specific:
# COPY client /app/client 
# COPY package.json /app
# COPY vite.config.ts /app
# ...
If the COPY command is too restrictive, or if you are using a .dockerignore file that is excluding the client directory, the file won't be available when npm run build runs.

2. Incorrect Relative Path in vite.config.ts
The path you set in rollupOptions.input is relative to the directory where the vite command is executed.

üîç Action: Explicitly Set root in vite.config.ts
While setting rollupOptions.input is a good step, for multi-root projects, setting the top-level root property in vite.config.ts is usually a cleaner and more effective way to tell Vite where your entry point and public files are located.

If your project structure is:

/ (root where vite.config.ts is)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ client/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html
You should set the root property to tell Vite to look in the client folder:

TypeScript

// vite.config.ts

import { defineConfig } from 'vite';

export default defineConfig({
  // 1. Tell Vite to use 'client' as the project root
  root: 'client',

  build: {
    // 2. The output directory will be at /app/client/dist 
    //    by default, or you can set a custom outDir.
    outDir: 'dist', 
    
    // 3. (Optional) Explicitly set the input file *relative to the new 'root'*
    //    Since we set root: 'client', the entry is just 'index.html'
    rollupOptions: {
      input: {
        main: 'index.html', // Now resolves to /app/client/index.html
      },
    },
  },
  // ...
});
By setting root: 'client', Vite will now execute as if it were in the client directory, and it will correctly find index.html
