ðŸš¨ For Future Imports
Instead of asking agent to "set up the project", simply say:

"Run the setup script in REPLIT_SETUP.md"

This will complete the entire setup in under 2 minutes with minimal agent utilization.

This automation setup saves ~80% of typical import analysis time

## Python Package Management on Replit

**Important**: This project uses **pip exclusively** on Replit due to Nix environment compatibility. The `uv` package manager is not compatible with Replit's read-only filesystem structure.

- **Primary dependency file**: `requirements.txt` (pinned with cryptographic hashes)
- **Development dependencies**: Use `pyproject.toml` for configuration, but `requirements.txt` for installation
- **Lock file**: `uv.lock` is ignored and excluded from the repository

### Updating Dependencies

To update Python dependencies:
1. Modify `pyproject.toml` as needed
2. Run `uv export --format requirements-txt > requirements.txt` locally (if using uv)
3. Or manually update `requirements.txt` with pinned versions
4. Commit the updated `requirements.txt`
